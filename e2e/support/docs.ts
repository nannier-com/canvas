/**
 * Driving the docs app from a browser: how to open a route in a known look, and
 * where the tooling hooks are.
 *
 * Two things about this app make a naive `goto` unreliable, and both are handled
 * here rather than in every spec:
 *
 *   1. The root layout renders NOTHING until the Geist faces load (a deliberate
 *      trade recorded in docs/src/app/_layout.tsx: rendering early moved Cumulative
 *      Layout Shift from 0.006 to 0.16). So "loaded" is not "painted", and the wait
 *      has to be for paint.
 *   2. The scheme and surface are seeded from the LAUNCH url only (?scheme, ?surface,
 *      read once via a ref in docs/src/theme/docs-theme.tsx, since the docs store
 *      nothing by privacy declaration). A client-side navigation cannot change them,
 *      and the app defaults to dark + glass.
 *
 * Reading the scheme back off the painted pixels covers both at once, and it is what
 * keeps a silent no-op from passing as a capture: the screenshot script this suite
 * replaced once seeded a localStorage key no part of the docs app reads (it belongs
 * to the kit's web CSS hand-off, which the docs do not use), so an entire "light"
 * screenshot set was really dark and nothing said so. This function fails instead.
