/**
 * How to open every overlay the kit ships, in one place.
 *
 * There are two things that drive these overlays: the end-to-end suite, which asserts
 * what they do, and lookout, which photographs and judges them. Both used to carry
 * their own copy of the list, and that is exactly how four of lookout's recipes went
 * stale unnoticed: Select was opened by the text of its current value, which stopped
 * matching when the example changed, so the sweep spent months judging a closed Select
 * as an open one. One list, two consumers.
 *
 * The only import is a type, erased at runtime, so this file loads under bun (which is
 * how lookout executes the config that reads it) without pulling in a test runner.
 * Each recipe takes the Playwright page AND the Playground stage, because the two
 * consumers scope the stage differently: the suite filters for the one containing a
 * preview card, lookout takes the first.
