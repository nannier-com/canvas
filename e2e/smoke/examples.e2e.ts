/**
 * Every Playground example on every component page, actually rendered.
 *
 * The route smoke opens each component page and sees its FIRST example. The other
 * 463 are one tab click away and are otherwise never executed by anything: the docs
 * typecheck proves they compile against the real prop types, which is what catches a
 * prop that does not exist, but a component that throws at render still typechecks.
 *
 * The catch is that a throw here is invisible to the console gate, because
 * ExampleErrorBoundary catches it and paints "Example failed to render" in its place.
 * So this is the one suite that has to look for that text.
 *
 * It also holds three things together that would otherwise drift apart: the example
 * labels in the component's markdown, the slugs docs/src/lib/variant.ts derives from
 * them, and the URL component-reference.tsx replaces into the address bar.
