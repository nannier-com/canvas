/**
 * Every route the docs app serves, loaded in a real browser.
 *
 * The valuable assertion here is not "it rendered" but the automatic error gate in
 * e2e/support/fixtures.ts: a react-native-web screen whose effect throws still paints
 * a plausible page, so a screenshot proves very little and a console-clean load proves
 * a lot. On top of that each route must paint in the scheme it was asked for, stay on
 * its own URL unless it is a declared redirect, and not scroll sideways.
 *
 * Each route is loaded twice, crossing the axes rather than taking the full matrix:
 * desktop in dark and phone in light. The scheme is seeded app-wide from the launch
 * URL, so it does not interact with the route, and running two of the four cells
 * covers both schemes and both shells at half the page loads.
