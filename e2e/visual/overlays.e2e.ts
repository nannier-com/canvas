/**
 * A picture of every overlay while it is open.
 *
 * The component baselines catch the resting state; an overlay's whole point is the
 * state you cannot see at rest. An open dialog's scrim, a menu's elevation, a
 * listbox's selected row: none of that appears in the card shot.
 *
 * Anchored overlays portal into the Playground's stage outlet, so the stage is the
 * frame. Drawer and ActionSheet go through react-native-web's Modal, which renders at
 * the document root, so those two are full-page.
