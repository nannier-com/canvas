# @nannier-com/canvas

**One universal React Native UI kit that renders natively on iOS and Android, and on the web through React Native Web, from a single component API.**

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nannier-com/canvas.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nannier-com/canvas) [![CI](https://github.com/nannier-com/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nannier-com/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [Documentation](https://canvas.nannier.com/)

**Try it live:** the [component catalog](https://canvas.nannier.com/components) renders the full library (atoms, molecules, organisms, and charts) in the browser, with dark mode, the glass surface, and density switchable site-wide.

Write your screen once and it runs everywhere. Canvas is built from React Native primitives, React Native SVG, and its own components, so the same tree renders on device and in the browser with each platform's skin. Components are styled with semantic boolean props, are accessible by default (roles and state exposed to assistive tech on all three platforms), and are authored desktop-first so they scale down cleanly to phone. On iOS 26 the functional layer (overlays and bars) renders in real Liquid Glass; on Chromium browsers it renders as a real lens (an SVG displacement filter that refracts the backdrop at the rim); elsewhere it falls back to a genuine frost or a solid surface.

## Install

```bash
npm install @nannier-com/canvas
```

Canvas ships compiled (no build step in your app) and declares three **required** peer dependencies you install alongside it:

```bash
npm install react react-native react-native-svg
```

### Optional peers

Install the optional peers needed by your app's features. The package remains usable without them, with the following fallbacks:

| Package | Install only if | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `react-native-qrcode-svg` | you render QR codes with `QRCode` | the accessible, sized frame remains empty and warns once in development |
| `expo-glass-effect` | you want native Liquid Glass on supported iOS 26+ devices | forced glass uses `expo-blur` when available, otherwise the skin's solid fill; automatic surface mode remains solid |
| `expo-blur` | you want frosted glass on non-Chromium web, Android, or older iOS | surfaces use their solid fill when no other material is available; native Liquid Glass and the Chromium lens still work |
| `expo-clipboard` | you want `CodeBlock` to copy text on native | web can use `navigator.clipboard`; native copying needs a supplied `onCopy` handler |
| `react-native-safe-area-context` | you want safe-area insets in Canvas shells, with your app's `SafeAreaProvider` | safe-area wrappers render as plain views without insets |
| `@shopify/react-native-skia` | you want `Backdrop` to use an available GPU drawing backend | `Backdrop` keeps its React Native SVG renderer |

```bash
# add any subset you actually use
npm install react-native-qrcode-svg expo-glass-effect expo-blur expo-clipboard react-native-safe-area-context @shopify/react-native-skia
```

## Quick start

Wrap your app once in `ThemeProvider`, then compose components imported from `@nannier-com/canvas`. The provider supplies the active color scheme, surface, and token map to every component below it.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, Button } from "@nannier-com/canvas";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Card padded>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>Welcome to Canvas</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <Button primary large onPress={() => console.log("saved")}>
            Save
          </Button>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

That exact tree renders natively on iOS and Android and, through React Native Web, in the browser. There is no separate web component set to learn.

For a complete runnable application, see the [Expo starter](./examples/starter/README.md). It independently installs the published Canvas package and includes workspace editing, validation, theme preferences, and nested overlays on web, iOS, and Android. Its source follows the repository's all-rights-reserved terms.

### Overlay hosting

Mount an `OverlayProvider` inside `ThemeProvider`, outside scrolling page content,
and let it fill the app window. Dropdowns, selects, autocompletes and popovers then
share measured viewport bounds, move above their triggers when needed, and scroll
long content within the available height. Opening a hosted menu preserves the
trigger's native view hierarchy and focus.

Nested providers can scope where cards render without restricting them to the
height of a short form. They inherit the root's visible bounds. Use
`<OverlayProvider viewport>` for a deliberately bounded nested panel, whose size
must come from its viewport rather than its content. Use
`<OverlayProvider separateWindow>` inside a custom React Native `Modal`; its
measurements must not inherit bounds from a different native window. Canvas
`Drawer` supplies this boundary automatically.

When page content scrolls under a header, declare the header's measured height as
`viewportInsets={{ top: headerHeight }}` on the root or a nested `viewport` host.
The optional `bottom` inset similarly reserves an overlapping footer. Insets are
relative to that host's own box and are intersected with the keyboard boundary;
changing them updates open cards without remounting their content.

Android keyboard avoidance supports full-screen edge-to-edge windows through
native keyboard events, and legacy resize-mode windows through their measured
root bounds. Legacy pan/nothing modes and multi-window coordinates are not
supported. iOS uses the keyboard frame; at the RN 0.74 support floor,
this requires a full-screen window because that RN version reports screen
coordinates. Current RN converts the frame to window coordinates. Web fitting
uses the layout viewport; RNW does not expose the mobile keyboard's visual
viewport. Clipping ancestors that are not viewport hosts do not contribute
additional bounds. With no provider, the legacy inline overlay remains available,
but has no viewport fitting or outside-tap backdrop.

### Styling with semantic boolean props

Every visual variation is a flat boolean prop named for its meaning; passing the prop turns it on, so the call site reads like natural language.

```jsx
<Button primary large>Save</Button>
<Button destructive>Delete</Button>
<Button ghost small>Cancel</Button>
<Badge success>Active</Badge>
<Card raised selected>...</Card>
```

Props are grouped into orthogonal axes (intent, size, density, plus stacking state and layout flags). Props on different axes combine freely; within one axis they are mutually exclusive, so you pass at most one and the component resolves any conflict by a fixed precedence.

```jsx
// Four props from four axes, all applied together.
<Button primary large loading block>Save</Button>
```

String-valued enum props such as `variant="primary"`, `size="lg"`, or `tone="destructive"` are not part of the API and are not accepted. The boolean form is the only styling surface, and there is no `style`-override escape hatch.

## Platforms

Canvas targets all three platforms from one install. The only thing that changes is which peers your app already provides.

- **Expo** apps use the required peers and any optional modules needed by their features. The docs app in this repository is a working Expo example, including native glass and blur modules.
- **Bare React Native** works the same way once the required peers are installed and linked (`react-native-svg` needs the usual autolinking / pod install). Add the optional peers if you want QRCode or full-fidelity glass.
- **Web via React Native Web** needs one bundler step: install `react-native-web` and alias `react-native` to `react-native-web`, exactly as any RNW project does. Web bundlers use the default `dist/index.js` entry. On the web you can also flip glass at runtime with the exported `setSurface("glass")` / `setSurface("solid")` DOM helper.

Metro selects `dist/native/index.js` through the `react-native` export condition
or legacy field. That compiled output preserves Metro's iOS and Android module
selection, including native material helpers. No custom Canvas resolver is needed
in consumer apps. Public declarations and the web ESM build remain in `dist/`.
`bun run dev` watches both outputs and syncs them to local consumer overlays.
`bun run verify-native-consumer` packs the build and bundles an isolated React
Native consumer for both platforms with all optional peers omitted. CI also runs
this check on the exact sealed tarball before it can be published.

## Theming

`ThemeProvider` reads the OS color scheme by default and exposes the resolved tokens to every Canvas component through the `useTheme` hook. Optional props control it:

- `dark` / `light` (booleans): the scheme axis, spelled like every other Canvas axis (`dark` wins if both are passed). Omit both to follow the OS appearance. The legacy `scheme` value prop (`"light" | "dark"`) stays supported for code that already holds a scheme value.
- `glass` / `solid` (booleans): the surface axis, spelled like every other Canvas axis. Omit both for the platform default (Liquid Glass on iOS 26+, solid everywhere else); pass `glass` to force the translucent functional-layer material, `solid` to force flat. `glass` wins if both are passed. The legacy `surface` value prop (`"solid" | "glass"`) stays supported for config-driven code holding a `Surface` value.
- `tokens`: brand token overrides merged over the active scheme, so you can rebrand without forking the token files. Pass a flat `Partial<ColorTokens>` to apply to both schemes, or `{ light, dark }` to override each separately. Use a stable reference (a module constant or memoized object).

```jsx
const brand = { primary: "#7c3aed" };

<ThemeProvider dark glass tokens={brand}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Documentation and components

Full docs, live examples, and the complete prop reference live at **<https://canvas.nannier.com/>**.

[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) ships with the package: the token values, the type roles,
the shape and elevation scales, and the four API rules that are easy to break by
accident. It is written to be read by an agent building on the kit as much as by a
person, and its numbers are generated from the kit's own sources.

The kit exports components across atoms, molecules, organisms, and charts, all from `@nannier-com/canvas`:

- **Forms and inputs**: Button, Button Group, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Slider, Stepper, Input OTP, Select, Autocomplete, Listbox.
- **Overlays**: Dialog, Alert Dialog, Drawer, Popover, Tooltip, Dropdown, Action Sheet, Toast, Command palette.
- **Navigation**: Tabs, Tab Bar, Navbars, Sidebar, Breadcrumb, Pagination, Steps.
- **Data and content**: Data Table, Stacked / Grid Lists, Stats, Calendar, Charts, Card, Avatar, Badge, Description Lists, Media Objects, QR Code.
- **Disclosure and feedback**: Accordion, Collapsible, Carousel, Progress, Skeleton, Spinner, Alert, Empty State.

Alongside the components, the package exports the style foundation: the theme runtime (`ThemeProvider`, `useTheme`), the design tokens (`token`, `hsl`), the responsive and motion helpers (`useResponsive`, `useReducedMotion`), the glass helpers (`liquidGlassAvailable`, `setSurface`), and React Native primitives (`View`, `Text`, `Pressable`, `TextInput`, `ScrollView`). `Image` is a Canvas atom with semantic fit props.
