/*
 * The privacy policy's text, as pure data with no renderer attached.
 *
 * Two consumers share this module, which is why it exists apart from the screen:
 * `app/(home)/privacy.tsx` renders it with Canvas components for the app, and
 * `tools/privacygen/generate.ts` bakes the same words into a STATIC page at
 * docs/public/privacy/index.html.
 *
 * The static page lets store reviewers read the policy without loading the app's
 * JavaScript. The shared web build copies it into the Cloudflare Pages artifact
 * and verifies its presence before browser tests and deployment.
 *
 * Every claim below must stay verifiable from the source: no analytics SDK, no account
 * system, no persistence of user data (the theme choice is in-memory session state; the
 * only disk write is expo-updates caching the app's own bundle), and exactly two
 * outbound hosts. These words are also the source of truth for the App Privacy and
 * Data Safety answers recorded in store/SUBMISSION.md.
