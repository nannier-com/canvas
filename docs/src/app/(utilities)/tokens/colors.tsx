            Canvas uses a semantic token system. Every color is a named token (primary, muted-foreground, border, …) that ships as a plain value per scheme. Components read the active set through useTheme() and build their React Native styles from it, so the same code themes correctly on iOS, Android, and the web, with no per-platform fork. You never touch the values directly: you pick a component's look with semantic boolean props.

            <Typography tiny muted>
              GlassSurface paints the real material per platform: Apple's Liquid Glass through expo-glass-effect on iOS 26+, a real lens on Chromium web (an SVG displacement filter that refracts the backdrop at the rim while the centre stays optically flat), a genuine frosted blur through expo-blur on non-Chromium web and Android, and the glass-tint fill above on its own as the final fallback. It is never a hand-painted blur on one component, and it never reaches into the semantic color set.
            </Typography>
            <Typography tiny muted>
              It only reads over something worth bending. Over a flat fill it renders flat, so a glass bar has to have content passing behind it.

            <Typography tiny muted>
              The option-list menus are the deliberate exception. A dropdown, select, autocomplete or avatar menu is a card of rows the reader picks from, and the Chromium lens keeps the centre of a pane optically flat by design, so a translucent menu shows the page straight through between its rows. Those, plus alert dialogs, toasts and chart tooltips, keep painting their opaque fill in glass mode exactly as in solid.
