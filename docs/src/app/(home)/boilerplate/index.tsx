          <Typography>Start with src/app/index.tsx and preferences.tsx. The root layout supplies SafeAreaProvider, ThemeProvider, overlay hosting and the navigation stack; src/state/session.tsx owns immutable drafts, validation and saved values.</Typography>
          <Typography muted>The UI uses Canvas components and semantic props. Typography follows Canvas's default platform/system fonts. No custom Geist assets are loaded, and Text is not globally modified.</Typography>
          <Typography>For an existing application, install Canvas and its required peers in that app instead. The starter's SDK57 dependencies are a complete Expo application baseline, not a dependency migration recipe.</Typography>
