/**
 * lookout config for the Canvas docs (https://github.com/nannier-com/lookout).
 *
 * Targets the running docs app (bun run dev in docs/, Metro on 8081) and derives
 * the component routes from nav.config.json, which check-nav-sync holds 1:1 with
 * the docs core, so this list cannot drift out from under the sweep.
 *
 * Canonical judging runs on the SOLID surface (?surface=solid pinned via the
 * target query): glass frosts are GPU-nondeterministic and would churn the
 * judge's hash cache. The 14 functional-layer components get a separate
 * glass-target pass. Scheme switches ride the docs' launch-URL seeding
 * (?scheme=dark|light), which also powers native light capture
 * (canvas:///components/button?scheme=light).
 *
 * Type-only imports: erased at runtime (bun executes this file directly), so
 * nothing here requires @nannier-com/lookout to be installed in canvas.
