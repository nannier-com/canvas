  // rejected. The three tables share so much vocabulary that separate shards gzip to
  // ~18.1KB against ~15.9KB together, so the split costs bytes; no shard lands near 2KB
  // anyway (the smallest is ~5.6KB); canvas.css imports all three regardless ("Link this
  // one file"); `styles/*` is a public export path, so moving the file breaks anyone
  // importing it directly; and the docs and the design mirror flip `data-platform` at
  // runtime, so they need all three loaded at once. Measured at 15,915B gzip, so 20KB
  // leaves roughly the same 1.3x headroom the JS budget carries: enough for more skin
  // tokens, tight enough to catch a doubling. It also trips before the 30KB total does,

// The shipped JavaScript budget: the whole kit, bundled with react / react-native /

// resolves from the outside), minified and gzipped. Raised from 135KB for the
// chart-buildout tier (13 further chart components beyond BarList and
// MetricBreakdown, each ~0.7-1KB gzip): measured 137.4KB gzip with the first two
// landed, so the old cap left no room for the planned roster. 160KB keeps the
// same intent: room for the deliberate growth, tight enough to catch an
// accidental doubling or a dependency creeping into the bundle.
//
// Raised again from 160KB for the GeoMap detail pass. The generated world data
// went from Natural Earth 1:110m land alone to 1:50m land PLUS the 1:50m internal
// country border mesh, on a viewBox widened from 1000 to 2000 units, which took
// src/charts/geo-map/geo-map.world.ts from 5.6KB to 23.8KB gzip and the measured
// bundle from 161.5KB to 180.8KB. The whole increase is one @generated data
// module: it is a pair of string constants with no logic, and it tree-shakes out
// entirely for a consumer who never imports GeoMap. 192KB leaves ~6% headroom over
// the measured figure. That is deliberately more slack than the 160KB cap ended up
// with (1.4%, which meant any addition at all failed CI) and still far under the
// 1.6x an accidental doubling would need.
