# Contributing to Canvas

Thanks for your interest in Canvas. This guide covers setting up a development
environment, the checks your change must pass, and the design principles every
contribution is reviewed against.

## Repo layout

The kit source lives in `src/` (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `charts/`,
`style/`, plus the theme and token modules). Build tooling lives in `tools/`
(docgen, icongen, favicongen, rastergen) and one-off scripts in `scripts/`. The CSS
foundation is in `styles/`, the test suite in `test/`, and the documentation app,
a universal Expo Router app that runs on iOS, Android, and web and doubles as the
published docs site, in `docs/` with its own `package.json`. Compiled output goes
to `dist/` (gitignored).

## Setup

Canvas uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for everything: install, scripts, and tests.

```bash
bun install            # root: kit dependencies
cd docs && bun install # docs app; its postinstall symlinks the kit source into place
```

The root install also installs the development-only Husky hooks through the
guarded `prepare` script. Git uses the relative `.husky/_` path, so hooks keep
working when the checkout moves or is used as a linked worktree. Run `bun run
prepare` from the root to repair an older checkout's hook configuration. CI,
production installs, and installs without Husky or a Git checkout skip this step;
the published package does not contain the hook installer.

To run the docs app (the kit's live showcase and your development harness):

```bash
cd docs && bun run dev # Metro on http://localhost:8081, native preview opener on :8790
```

Component edits hot-reload into the docs. Note that Metro does not hot-watch the
symlinked kit source in every case; if a kit edit does not show up, restart with
`bun run dev --clear`.

## Checks

The pre-push hook runs the following local checks in order and stops on the first
failure. Building before verification and tests ensures they use fresh compiled
output:

```bash
bun run typecheck         # kit TypeScript
bun run typecheck:e2e     # end-to-end suite TypeScript
bun run lint              # ESLint, including docs and tests
bun run build             # refresh the published package's compiled output
bun run verify-package    # compiled entry points, imports, and public types
bun run test              # unit tests and compiled-package smoke tests
bun run docs:gen:check     # generated docs match their source
bun run raster:gen:check   # generated native menu glyphs match their source
bun run designmd:gen:check # generated design reference matches its source
bunx tsc --noEmit -p docs/src/core/tsconfig.json # generated example TypeScript
```

CI remains the release authority. It also checks the complete docs app and web
export, browser behavior, theme tokens, design parity, and size budgets. The local
hook does not run the browser suite or deploy anything.

Use `bun run test` to run every unit test under `test/` and `tools/`, with the
shared React Native Web preload from `bunfig.toml`. For a focused run, use a path
starting with `./`, for example `bun test ./test/behavior.test.tsx`. Rooted paths
keep Bun's discovery within the test trees instead of scanning the entire
checkout and retaining enough directory handles to break subprocess tests on
macOS.

## Changesets

Any change that ships in the published package (component code, styles, tokens,
public types) needs a changeset:

```bash
bun run changeset
```

Pick `patch` for fixes, `minor` for new capabilities, and write the summary for a
consumer reading the changelog. Docs-only and tooling-only changes do not need one.

## Design principles

Canvas is opinionated, and pull requests are reviewed against these rules. The full
versions live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

- **React Native everywhere.** Components are built from React Native primitives
  (`react-native`, `react-native-svg`, the kit's own primitives) so one codebase
  renders on iOS, Android, and web. No web-only escape hatches: no reaching into the
  DOM, no raw CSS on nodes, no `Platform.OS === "web"` markup forks. If React Native
  lacks a primitive, build the effect cross-platform (SVG, style props, math).
- **Semantic boolean props.** Styling is expressed as flat boolean props named for
  meaning (`<Button primary large>`), never string enums (`variant="primary"`).
  Props group into axes (intent, size, density, state); one prop per axis.
- **No styling escape hatches.** A component's look comes from its semantic props
  and the kit's layout primitives, never from `style={{...}}` overrides at the call
  site. If a capability is missing, add it to the kit as a prop or component.
- **Dogfooding.** Every UI element in this repo, docs included, is a Canvas
  component or kit primitive. If the kit lacks something, create or extend the kit
  component rather than hand-rolling a look-alike.
- **Responsive, desktop-first.** Every component adapts from large desktop down to
  phone; author the desktop case first, then scale down.
