# Native tooling evidence fixtures

`maestro-2.10-carousel-ios.log` is the exact single `JsConsole` line captured on
2026-09-08 by Maestro 2.10.0 during the targeted immutable 2e1 iOS Carousel
measurement. No identifiers, whitespace or measurement fields were rewritten.

- Original evidence: `/private/tmp/canvas-carousel-continuity-20260908/runs/ios/light/measurement.json`
  identifies the full flow-scoped source log and manifest.

Both targeted iOS phases passed. The enclosing scratch recorder failed its
separate installed-path equality check after phase A's original `clearState`
reinstalled identical app bytes under a new simulator container. That result
remains unchanged. This fixture proves the real logging format, not a complete
ordinary native or assistive-technology pass. The unit test creates a temporary
manifest around this real line; it does not represent that manifest as captured.
