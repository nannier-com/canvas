// building on it. Its value depends on two things being true at once: that the numbers
// are the kit's real numbers, which `designmd:gen --check` enforces in CI, and that the
// frontmatter is actually parseable by whatever reads it, which is what this asserts.

// The schema is the one the design-md library uses for the 74 production systems it
// documents, so a tool that can read one of those can read this.
