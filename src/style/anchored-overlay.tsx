// AnchoredOverlay: a floating card fitted beside a trigger, with
// cross-platform outside-tap dismissal, from RN primitives only.
//
// When an <OverlayProvider> is mounted (an app root, or a docs example stage),
// the card plus a full-bleed dismiss backdrop are portaled into its outlet and
// the card is positioned at the trigger's coordinates measured RELATIVE TO the
// outlet (measureInWindow on both, subtract). So the card escapes the trigger's
// bounds with NO position:"fixed" and NO Platform.OS branch, and a tap anywhere
// off the card dismisses it on every platform.
//
// With no provider it degrades to the kit's pre-portal inline anchor (the
// caller's own absolute top:100% style, passed as `inlineStyle`), so an unhosted
// consumer still renders — just without the over-the-page escape or the backdrop,
// exactly as the kit behaved before the portal layer.
//
// Width is the caller's concern: it already measures its trigger (onLayout) and
// passes the card's width/min-width via `cardStyle`. This helper owns only the
// placement, available height, the backdrop, and the card's surface material.
//
// Surface: an anchored card is a functional-layer overlay, so by default it
// renders through GlassSurface and takes the active material (real Liquid Glass
// on iOS 26+, the lens on Chromium web, a frost elsewhere) whenever the theme's
// surface mode is glass. The OPTION-LIST MENUS opt out with `opaque`: a
// dropdown / select / autocomplete / row menu / split-button overflow menu is a
// card of content rows, and a see-through card lets the page's own rows and
// rules read straight between them. Those paint their skin's own `popover` fill
// on a plain box, in glass mode exactly as in solid mode. Popovers, the command
// palette, and the calendar peek keep the material.
