// Entrance: a one-shot open animation for glass overlays, so a menu/popover appears
// to pop open FROM the control that triggered it and a dialog scale-fades into place —
// Apple's Liquid Glass "morph between related states". It wraps content in an
// Animated.View OUTSIDE the GlassSurface (the material scales with the card, and
// GlassSurface's public API is untouched), animating only transform + opacity (safe on
// Android's New Architecture, unlike animated layout) as a single spring. It is
// OPEN-ONLY: overlays in the kit unmount synchronously, so there is no exit animation.
//
// Under Reduce Motion the animation is skipped and the final frame renders statically
// (Apple: disable elastic/morph effects when Reduce Motion is on).
