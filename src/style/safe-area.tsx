// `SafeAreaView` is deprecated and slated for removal; safe-area-context is the standard
// replacement (and a de-facto requirement of Expo Router / React Navigation, so real
// apps already ship it). When it is installed we use its `SafeAreaView` (real insets on
// every platform, driven by a `SafeAreaProvider`); when it is absent we fall back to a
// plain `View`, which matches the old core `SafeAreaView` off iOS (insets resolve to 0).
// This keeps the kit installable and buildable for consumers who skip the peer, and
// removes the core-`SafeAreaView` deprecation warning. See glass-surface for the same
// guarded literal-require pattern.
