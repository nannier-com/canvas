# Autocomplete

Text input + dropdown: searchable single-select. Pass `label` (and `required`) to name the field: iOS and web render the label above the field, while Android floats the Material 3 in-container label once the list opens or a value fills the field. The field renders at the standard width by default (`narrow` and `wide` pick the other modes, `block` fills the container).

Arrow Down and Arrow Up open the list and highlight an option while focus stays in the text field. Navigation stops at the first and last matches. Home and End jump to those limits once an option is highlighted; otherwise they retain their text-editing behavior. Enter chooses the highlighted option, Escape closes the list without changing the query, and Tab closes it while moving focus. Typing resets the highlight. Confirming an input-method candidate does not select an option or submit a surrounding Form.

Use `value` with `onValueChange` to control the selection, and use `""` for a controlled empty value. The callback reports selections and clearing the field. `onSelect` remains a selection-only notification. The independent `query`/`onQueryChange` pair controls filtering; choosing an option resets the query to `""`.

The disclosure button has a real target of at least 24px on web, 44pt on iOS, and 48dp on Android. The small iOS field keeps a 44pt height so its touch target fits inside the field; its typography remains compact.

## Usage

```tsx
<Autocomplete
  options={[
    "Ada Lovelace",
    "Grace Hopper",
    "Kira Tanaka",
    "Liang Bao",
    "Marcus Allen",
    "Noor Park",
    "Rachel Chen"
  ]}
  label="Assigned to"
  placeholder="Search a person…"
/>
```

## Variants

### Controlled selection

```tsx
<Stateful initial="Grace Hopper">
  {(value, setValue) => (
    <Column snug>
      <Autocomplete
        label="Assigned to"
        options={["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Kira Tanaka"]}
        value={value}
        onValueChange={setValue}
      />
      <Typography muted>{value === "" ? "No assignee" : `Selected: ${value}`}</Typography>
    </Column>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

### Required field

```tsx
<Autocomplete
  options={[
    "Ada Lovelace",
    "Grace Hopper",
    "Kira Tanaka",
    "Liang Bao",
    "Marcus Allen",
    "Noor Park",
    "Rachel Chen"
  ]}
  label="Assigned to"
  required
  placeholder="Search a person…"
/>
```

### With helper text

```tsx
<Autocomplete
  options={[
    "Ada Lovelace",
    "Grace Hopper",
    "Kira Tanaka",
    "Liang Bao",
    "Marcus Allen",
    "Noor Park",
    "Rachel Chen"
  ]}
  label="Assigned to"
  helperText="The person responsible for this account."
  placeholder="Search a person…"
/>
```

### Disabled

```tsx
<Autocomplete
  options={[
    "Ada Lovelace",
    "Grace Hopper",
    "Kira Tanaka",
    "Liang Bao",
    "Marcus Allen",
    "Noor Park",
    "Rachel Chen"
  ]}
  label="Assigned to"
  placeholder="Search a person…"
  disabled
/>
```

### Widths

```tsx
<Column snug>
  <Autocomplete narrow options={["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper"]} placeholder="Narrow (240px)" />
  <Autocomplete options={["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper"]} placeholder="Standard (320px)" />
  <Autocomplete wide options={["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper"]} placeholder="Wide (480px)" />
  <Autocomplete block options={["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper"]} placeholder="Block (fills the container)" />
</Column>
```

## Do & Don't

### When to use

**Do** — A plain select for short, fixed lists; reserve the autocomplete for long, searchable ones.

```tsx
<Select label="Size" options={["Small", "Medium", "Large"]} placeholder="Select a size" />
```

**Don't** — Type or click: a search field for three fixed options is overhead with nothing to filter.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Size" options={["Small", "Medium", "Large"]} placeholder="Search…" />
```

### Filtering

**Do** — Type a few letters: the list narrows as you go, so a long list stays usable.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={[
    "Wade Cooper",
    "Arlene Mccoy",
    "Devon Webb",
    "Tom Cook",
    "Tanya Fox",
    "Hellen Schmidt"
  ]} defaultQuery="co" />
```

**Don't** — Try typing: a plain dropdown wearing a search placeholder ignores every keystroke, so a long list stays as long as it started.

```tsx
<Select label="Assigned to" options={[
    "Wade Cooper",
    "Arlene Mccoy",
    "Devon Webb",
    "Tom Cook",
    "Tanya Fox",
    "Hellen Schmidt"
  ]} placeholder="Search a person…" />
```

### Selection

**Do** — Click an option: it fills the input and stays marked as selected.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb", "Tom Cook"]} defaultValue="Devon Webb" />
```

**Don't** — Click an option: the field is pinned to an empty `value`, so the list closes on nothing and you can't tell what you picked.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb", "Tom Cook"]} value="" placeholder="Pick a person…" />
```

### With label

**Do** — A persistent label keeps the field named after a selection has filled the input.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} defaultValue="Devon Webb" />
```

**Don't** — Once a value replaces the placeholder, an unlabeled field has nothing left to name it.

```tsx
<Autocomplete options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} defaultValue="Devon Webb" />
```

### With helper text

**Do** — A short placeholder plus persistent helper text keeps the rule visible while you type.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} placeholder="Search a person…" helperText="Deactivated users are hidden from the list." />
```

**Don't** — Type a letter: guidance crammed into the placeholder vanishes the moment you start.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} placeholder="Pick an active teammate; deactivated users are hidden" />
```

### Disabled

**Do** — Show the locked value and say why it's fixed, so disabled reads as a settled choice.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} defaultValue="Devon Webb" disabled helperText="Set by the project owner and can't be changed here." />
```

**Don't** — An empty, dimmed field with no value reads as broken, not as intentionally locked.

```tsx
<Autocomplete label="Assigned to" options={["Wade Cooper", "Arlene Mccoy", "Devon Webb"]} disabled placeholder="Search a person…" />
```
