// optional trailing keyboard shortcut, with hairline separators between groups
// and red-tinted destructive rows), the public boolean-prop API, the
// controlled/uncontrolled open state, the trigger/select close handlers, the
// outside-tap dismissal, the disabled handling, and accessibility all live
// here once. A platform file supplies only its skin (the menu card shape/fill/
// border, the separators, the row sizing, and the press feedback) and calls
// createDropdown.
//
// The trigger defaults to an outline button labelled by `trigger`. Pass
// `children` to supply a CUSTOM trigger instead (e.g. an avatar account chip in
// a topbar): the children render in place of the button, inside a Pressable that
// toggles the menu. Either way the menu rows still come from `items`.
//
// Overlay note: the open menu renders through AnchoredOverlay. When an
// OverlayProvider is mounted (an app root, or a docs example stage) the menu is
// portaled over the page, anchored below the trigger, and a tap anywhere off it
// dismisses it — identically on iOS, Android, and web, with no Platform.OS branch
// and no position:fixed. With no provider it falls back to an inline card
// positioned absolutely below the trigger (the kit's pre-portal behavior).
//
// There are no visual style axes on the menu itself, so there is no boolean-prop
// precedence to resolve; the per-item `destructive` flag is the only variant and
// it is scoped to its own row.
