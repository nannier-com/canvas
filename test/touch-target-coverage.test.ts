// it, a measured control whose touch area is extended to the minimum. What is NOT
// acceptable is a control that is short and has none of them, and that is what this
// enumerates, so a new pressable cannot join the kit unnoticed.

// The sizes quoted in KNOWN_GAP were measured in a real browser against the docs'
// iOS and Android preview rows, which render the actual per-OS skins, by walking
// every pressable in each row and comparing its box to that platform's minimum.
// hitSlop is invisible to that measurement, which is why the two lists below are
// separate: one is "reaches it another way", the other is "does not reach it".
