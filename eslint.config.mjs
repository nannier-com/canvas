// Focused ESLint flat config. This is NOT a full style linter (Prettier/format is
// deliberately not adopted); it enables ONLY the rule classes the 2026 audit proved
// this hook-heavy kit needs and that tsc + the test suite cannot catch:
//   - react-hooks/rules-of-hooks: a hook called conditionally is a real bug.
//   - react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: a stale-closure warning (non-blocking).
//   - react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values: a fresh context value object every
//     render re-renders every consumer (the RadioGroup finding).
//   - no static imports of the optional peers in src/** (they load via a guarded
//     require(); a value import breaks consumers who skip the peer).
//   - no Trusted Types sinks in src/**: they throw under a strict CSP, and a sink
//     on a module's import path takes the whole consuming app down with it.

// config of its own, so ESLint resolves THIS file and then found every path it was
// handed already ignored (ESLint 9 exits 2 on that). Docs source is React Native code
// with the same hooks hazards as the kit, so it gets the same rules.
