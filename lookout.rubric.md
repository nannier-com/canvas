# Canvas project rubric

Canvas is a universal React Native UI kit: one component API, three platform
skins. On the docs, every component page's preview card stacks three rows in
this order: **iOS** (top), **Android** (middle), **Web** (bottom), each row
labeled by a small corner watermark. Judge each row against ITS platform's
rules below, and compare rows of the same example: structure may differ per
platform idiom; content must not.

## Platform reference: Android rows (Material 3)

Judge shape, sizing, type, and anatomy against these values when the control
class matches; cite them as "M3 <value> (canvas rubric)":

- Shape scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 28 / full. Buttons read as full pills; cards
  12dp; dialogs and bottom-sheet tops 28dp; menus and snackbars 4dp.
- Sizing: button container 40dp with a 48dp touch target; text field 56dp;
  menu item 48dp; navigation bar 80dp; top app bar 64dp; switch track 32dp
  tall with an outlined track and small dot when off; checkbox 18dp; radio
  20dp.
- Type roles: button and menu labels read as label-large (14/20 medium);
  dialog headlines around 24sp.
- Anatomy: dialog actions are right-aligned text buttons; tabs use an
  underline indicator; snackbars carry an inline action; button groups read
  connected, not iOS-segmented.

## Platform reference: iOS rows (HIG)

- Buttons are capsules with semibold labels; press feedback dims (about 0.8
  opacity), never ripples.
- Touch targets at least 44pt.
- Alerts are centered with stacked or paired actions; sheets slide from the
  bottom with a grabber.
- Liquid Glass belongs to the FUNCTIONAL layer only (overlays, bars); content
  surfaces (cards, lists, tables) stay solid.

## Platform reference: Web rows

- The established Canvas look: medium-rounded corners, medium-weight labels,
  visible focus treatment on keyboard focus, hover affordances.
- No minimum touch target; pointer targets are visual-sized.

## Cross-row comparison

- The same example's rows must show the SAME content and state; a row missing
  content its siblings have is a defect (category anatomy or render-failure).
- An Android row pixel-identical to the Web row for a component that should
  have a distinct Material skin suggests a skin-injection failure: file it
  once as render-failure / skin-injection on the Android row, and do not
  style-judge those rows further.

## Components without a platform spec

Charts and several composites have no iOS or Material catalog counterpart.
Judge those rows for platform plausibility only: on-scale radii, coherent
type roles, the right feedback family, no cross-platform idiom bleed. Never
cite a numeric spec that does not appear in this rubric.

## Touch targets

Touch-target minimums are enforced in code via minTarget plus hitSlop, which
is INVISIBLE in pixels. Do not file touch-target findings from screenshots;
that channel is code review, not vision. (Visually absurd targets, like a
control a few pixels tall, are still states/anatomy findings.)

## Glass pass (target "glass")

Glass shots exist to catch glass-specific defects only: unreadable text over
the material, missing overlay scrims, content-layer surfaces (cards, tables)
wrongly rendered as glass. The material's translucency, blur radius, and
frost texture are by design; solid-pass findings must not be re-filed from
glass shots.

## Craft (added in v2)

These are the things a careful reviewer notices in a still image without
measuring anything. File one only when it is visible at a glance; if you had to
look for it, it is not a finding.

### States the example sets must read

An example whose props set `disabled`, `checked`, `selected`, `loading` or
`error` has to SHOW that state. A disabled control indistinguishable from its
enabled sibling, a selected tab with no indicator, a loading surface identical
to its resting one: those are `states` findings. Never file the absence of a
hover or press effect from a resting shot; nothing is being hovered or pressed.

### Corners of nested surfaces

A surface sitting flush inside another must not be MORE rounded than what
contains it, or the container's corner cuts it. A menu row inside a menu, a
thumb inside a track, a cell inside a panel. This is `consistency`, or
`alignment` when the inner shape plainly does not fit. It does not apply to a
detached, inset element: an iOS action sheet's capsule rows sit away from their
container's corners on purpose.

### Optical alignment

An icon visibly off the centre line of the label beside it, a glyph off-centre
in its circle, a label off-centre in its pill. `alignment`, and only when it
reads as wrong rather than measures as wrong.

### Icon family and stroke

Icons in one view from two families, or at two stroke weights. `consistency`.
The kit draws its entire set from one constant, so a mismatch is a caller or an
example using something that is not a Canvas icon.

### Numerals in a column

A table or a stats row whose digits do not line up vertically down a numeric
column, or whose figures visibly change width. `typography`.

### Measure and orphans

Prose in a card, alert or empty state running much past ninety characters a
line. A heading or title that wraps a single word onto its last line.
`typography`.

### Text too small to read

A label unreadable at the shot's own scale. `typography`, or `a11y` when it is
the label of a control. Platform exception: 10pt iOS tab-bar labels and 12sp
Material label-small are those platforms' own sizes; do not file them.

### Light direction and depth

Shadows in one view implying two different light sources, or a shadow heavy
enough to read as a border rather than as depth. `consistency`, or `composition`
when it is the whole view's problem.

### Box in box

More than two nested bordered or filled surfaces where the nesting buys no
hierarchy: a bordered card inside a bordered panel inside a bordered section.
`composition`.

### Empty and loading compositions

When an example is meant to show an empty or a loading state, blank space where
a composed empty state or a skeleton belongs is a `states` finding. Do not infer
a missing state from an example that is not about one.

## Do not file (extends the touch-target rule above)

- The design language itself: the indigo primary, the chart series hues, colour
  saturation, "one accent colour", the Geist typeface, the pure-white light
  surfaces, hairline card borders, the corner-radius scale, information density.
  Those are decisions, and the config's `neverFile` list records the ones that
  keep being re-litigated.
- Landing-page and marketing critique: hero size, section rhythm, three-column
  grids, "this needs more motion". This is a component library; its pages are
  specimens, not a funnel.
- Icon-set taste. The glyphs are Lucide-derived by choice.
- Sample content, unless it is literally placeholder text.
- Touch targets, still: they are enforced in code with minTarget plus hitSlop,
  which is invisible in pixels, and there is a test that reads them.
